# Driving Towards Unified Autonomous Driving: A Planning-Oriented Approach

## Introduction

Autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements over the past decade, with numerous breakthroughs in perception, prediction, and planning modules. However, integrating these modules into a cohesive system remains a significant challenge. Traditional autonomous driving systems often adopt a modular approach, where perception, prediction, and planning are treated as separate entities. While this division simplifies development, it introduces issues such as error accumulation and misalignment between tasks.

Imagine if we could design an autonomous driving system where all components work harmoniously, with each module optimized to serve the ultimate goal: safe and efficient planning. This idea is the cornerstone of a recent paper titled **"Planning-Oriented Autonomous Driving"** by Yihan Hu et al.

In this blog post, we'll delve deep into the concepts and methodologies introduced in this paper. We'll explore how the authors propose a unified framework, **UniAD (Unified Autonomous Driving)**, that incorporates full-stack driving tasks into a single end-to-end system. We'll discuss the motivations behind this approach, the architectural innovations, and the experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.

Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or enthusiast in the field of autonomous driving, this comprehensive overview will provide valuable insights into how a planning-oriented philosophy can revolutionize autonomous vehicle systems.

## The Modular Challenge in Autonomous Driving

### Traditional Modular Approach

Most contemporary autonomous driving systems are designed with a series of modules operating sequentially:

1. **Perception**: Detection and tracking of objects in the environment.
2. **Prediction**: Anticipating future states or motions of observed objects.
3. **Planning**: Determining the optimal trajectory for the ego vehicle based on perceived and predicted information.

While modularity allows for focused development on individual components, it often leads to each module being optimized independently. This independence can result in:

- **Error Accumulation**: Mistakes in early modules propagate downstream, affecting the entire system's performance.
- **Feature Misalignment**: Information loss occurs as outputs from one module may not fully capture nuances needed by subsequent modules.
- **Deficient Task Coordination**: Modules may not effectively share information that could be beneficial for overall performance.

### Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Paradigm

To address these challenges, some approaches adopt a multi-task learning framework. In MTL:

- A shared backbone network extracts features used by all tasks.
- Separate task-specific heads handle individual modules like detection, prediction, etc.

While MTL can improve computational efficiency and enable feature sharing, it may not fully resolve negative transfer between tasks—where learning one task adversely affects another.

## A Planning-Oriented Philosophy

### The Case for Planning-Oriented Design

The authors argue that since the ultimate goal of an autonomous driving system is safe and efficient planning, all other modules should be designed and optimized to serve this purpose. This planning-oriented philosophy involves:

- Reconsidering the necessity and role of each preceding task (perception and prediction).
- Prioritizing tasks based on how much they contribute to planning.
- Ensuring seamless communication between modules to reduce error propagation.

### Limitations of Previous Approaches

1. **End-to-End Planning without Intermediate Supervision**: Some approaches directly predict the planned trajectory from raw sensor inputs. While this can reduce system complexity, it often lacks interpretability and may not guarantee safety in dynamic urban environments.

2. **Partial Integration**: Other methods may integrate some perception and prediction tasks but neglect others. For instance, they might perform detection and motion prediction but omit mapping or tracking, leading to incomplete situational awareness.

## Introducing UniAD: Unified Autonomous Driving

### Overview of UniAD

UniAD is a comprehensive framework that integrates five essential tasks into a single end-to-end system:

1. **3D Object Detection and Tracking**
2. **Online Mapping**
3. **Motion Forecasting**
4. **Occupancy Prediction**
5. **Planning**

At its core, UniAD is designed to be planning-oriented. All modules are interconnected through unified query interfaces, allowing for rich feature sharing and coordination. This approach ensures that preceding tasks effectively contribute to the planning module.

### Key Contributions

- **Unified Query Design**: Utilizing query-based interfaces allows for flexible and expressive interactions between modules.
- **Comprehensive Integration**: Incorporating full-stack driving tasks in one network ensures that no crucial information is omitted.
- **Planning-Oriented Optimization**: By focusing on the ultimate goal—planning—the system is better aligned to produce safe and efficient trajectories.

## Deep Dive into UniAD Modules

Let's explore each component of UniAD in detail.

### 1. Perception: Detection and Tracking (TrackFormer)

#### Motivation

Understanding the environment requires accurately detecting and tracking objects over time. Traditional methods may treat detection and tracking separately, leading to inconsistencies.

#### Approach

**TrackFormer** unifies detection and multi-object tracking by:

- **Shared Queries**: Introducing detection queries for new objects and track queries for existing ones.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Track queries are updated over time, maintaining consistent identities for objects.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizing transformer decoder layers to model relationships between objects and extract rich features.

#### Benefits

- **End-to-End Training**: Avoids non-differentiable post-processing steps common in tracking-by-detection methods.
- **Temporal Feature Aggregation**: Enhances object representations by leveraging temporal information.

### 2. Perception: Online Mapping (MapFormer)

#### Motivation

High-definition (HD) maps provide valuable information about the road environment but are often costly to maintain. Online mapping allows the vehicle to understand its surroundings in real-time.

#### Approach

**MapFormer** performs online mapping by:

- **Panoptic Segmentation**: Combining instance segmentation (things like lanes, dividers) and semantic segmentation (stuff like drivable areas).
- **Map Queries**: Representing road elements as queries that capture spatial and semantic information.
- **Transformer Layers**: Similar to TrackFormer, MapFormer uses transformer decoder layers for feature extraction.

#### Benefits

- **Dynamic Map Generation**: Adapts to changes in the environment without relying on pre-built HD maps.
- **Enhanced Interaction Modeling**: Provides valuable context for motion forecasting by understanding static road elements.

### 3. Prediction: Motion Forecasting (MotionFormer)

#### Motivation

Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding agents is crucial for safe planning. Accurate motion forecasting requires considering interactions between agents and with the environment.

#### Approach

**MotionFormer** predicts future motions by:

- **Scene-Centric Paradigm**: Modeling the scene as a whole rather than focusing on individual agents in isolation.
- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Capturing agent-agent and agent-map interactions using transformer layers.
- **Goal-Oriented Refinement**: Incorporating goal points to refine trajectory predictions.
- **Ego-Vehicle Query**: Introducing a query to explicitly model the ego vehicle's interactions.

#### Technical Details

- **Motion Queries**: Consist of query context and query position, which includes scene-level anchors, agent-level anchors, current positions, and predicted endpoints.
  
  $$ Q_{\text{pos}} = \text{MLP}(\text{PE}(I^s)) + \text{MLP}(\text{PE}(I^a)) + \text{MLP}(\text{PE}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0)) + \text{MLP}(\text{PE}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_T^{l-1})) $$

  Where:
  
  - \( I^s \): Scene-level anchors
  - \( I^a \): Agent-level anchors
  - \( \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 \): Current position
  - \( \hat{\mathbf{x}}_T^{l-1} \): Predicted endpoint from the previous layer
  - \( \text{PE}(\cdot) \): Positional encoding
  - \( \text{MLP} \): Multi-layer perceptron

- **Layered Refinement**: Predictions are refined over multiple transformer layers, allowing for coarse-to-fine adjustments.

#### Benefits

- **Joint Prediction**: Simultaneously predicts trajectories for all agents, capturing social interactions.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Layered refinement and goal-oriented interactions enhance prediction quality.

### 4. Prediction: Occupancy Prediction (OccFormer)

#### Motivation

While motion forecasting focuses on sparse agent trajectories, occupancy prediction provides a dense representation of how the environment evolves over time. Combining both offers a comprehensive view.

#### Approach

**OccFormer** predicts future occupancy by:

- **Dense Scene Features**: Leveraging BEV (bird's-eye view) features to model the environment.
- **Agent-Level Incorporation**: Integrating agent features to predict occupancy changes associated with specific objects.
- **Pixel-Agent Interaction**: Using attention mechanisms to allow pixels to attend to relevant agents.
  
  The pixel-agent interaction can be represented as:
  
  $$ D_{\text{ds}}^t = \text{MHCA}( \text{MHSA}(F_{\text{ds}}^t), G^t, \text{attn\_mask} = O_m^t ) $$

  Where:
  
  - \( F_{\text{ds}}^t \): Downscaled dense feature at time \( t \)
  - \( G^t \): Agent features at time \( t \)
  - \( \text{MHSA} \): Multi-head self-attention
  - \( \text{MHCA} \): Multi-head cross-attention
  - \( O_m^t \): Attention mask guiding the interaction

#### Benefits

- **Scene-Level Understanding**: Provides a complete picture of future occupancy, including static and dynamic elements.
- **Identity Preservation**: Maintains agent identities within occupancy maps, aiding in decision-making.

### 5. Planning

#### Motivation

The planning module requires rich contextual information to make safe and efficient decisions. By incorporating outputs from both perception and prediction modules, the planner can generate better trajectories.

#### Approach

The planning module:

- **Ego-Vehicle Query Utilization**: Uses the refined ego-vehicle query from MotionFormer.
- **Occupancy Integration**: Considers predicted occupancy maps to avoid collisions.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Attends to BEV features to gather environmental information.
- **Trajectory Optimization**: Performs optimization to refine the planned trajectory based on predicted occupancy.

  The optimization can be formulated as:

  $$ \tau^* = \arg \min_{\tau} f(\tau, \hat{\tau}, \hat{O}) $$

  Where:
  
  - \( \tau \): Candidate trajectories
  - \( \hat{\tau} \): Initial planned trajectory
  - \( \hat{O} \): Predicted occupancy
  - \( f(\cdot) \): Cost function considering trajectory deviation and collision risk

#### Benefits

- **Safety Assurance**: Reduces collision risks by explicitly considering occupancy predictions.
- **Improved Performance**: Produces more accurate and reliable plans by leveraging rich contextual information.
